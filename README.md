# StickerPeople
The source code for the open source website, Sticker People


#About:
Sticker people aims to be an online community of both sticker aritsts and sticker lovers. At it's heart - it's a passion project built by a sticker fan, on the sidelines, it's a way for me to build a project and expand my skill set instead of becoming stale in my career.

In that regard, I'm open to absolutely all feedback from you, our community.
Whilst this project is still in it's very early stages, this ReadMe will act like a small notepad blog for me to track ideas etc.


#Feature List:
- User registration & Login
- Security on login / sign up ( This is something I am keen to get better at )
- user profiles / ability to edit
- user & sticker search, based upon filters & tagging system
- users MUST be able to sell stickers via third party services
- users can follows, review, and becoming 'friends' or similar with other artists
- stickers will feature a 'similar to' or 'people liked' thing. I'd love to do some kind of smart A.I type thing with this.
- we want to add some freelance/business/promotional work in for our artists. It would be amazing if even one user made a freelance gig due to his work.
- FREE stickers!? - Why don't we scrape the subreddit 'free stickers' for free stickers for our users?
